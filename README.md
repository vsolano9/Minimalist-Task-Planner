# Minimalist-Task-Planner

Description: A distraction-free to-do list app that focuses on one day at a time. Users can add tasks for today (and maybe tomorrow) with a beautiful, clutter-free interface. The core feature is just listing tasks and checking them off – no complex project management. This simplicity lets you make the UI extremely clean and even fun to use (e.g. satisfying check-off animations).
Target Audience: Productivity enthusiasts and busy individuals who feel overwhelmed by complex planners and want a simple daily organizer.

Monetization: Freemium model – the basic planner is free, while a premium tier could offer themes, reminders, or cloud sync across devices for a monthly fee. Alternatively, a one-time purchase for a “pro” version (unlocking all features) could work for solo users.

Tech Stack: A lightweight web stack – for example, a React or Vue frontend for a snappy UI, with a minimal backend (Firebase or Supabase) to store tasks if cloud sync/login is offered. You could even start purely client-side (local storage for data) to keep it simple, adding a Node/Express or serverless backend later for user accounts.
